THIS IS TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I DID EXACTLY
_____________________________________________________________________________

First Part: Test Design

-Downloaded the android version
-Wrote 12 Test Scenarios, their prioritization according to their possible business impact and they're documented in the "Test Design" file
_____________________________________________________________________________

Second Part: Bug Reporting 

-Found 7 bugs and they're documented in the "Bug reporting" file
-I had a strong product sense and managed to spot UX issues
_____________________________________________________________________________

Third Part: Test Automation

-Documented 10 tests cases in the "Automation testcases" file
-Implemented the 10 testcases from the previous step
-Managed to focus on the points I'll be evaluated on so:
1-The codestrucure is good. The project (instabug) has 2 classes(loginTests and HomePage)
2-I managed to implement a design pattern called the Page Object Model design pattern where I add a new class for every new page in the application thats why I added the HomePage class for the successful tests that opens the HomePage for the customers
3-Tests implementation are so easy and understandable also I left notes to make my code very clean

The 10 automated testcases are passed.
